# Homelab

## Purpose

This repository serves as a central hub for tracking the implementation of various ideas for my personal homelab. It is a space designed to document the evolution, configuration, and enhancement of my homelab infrastructure.

## Current Ideas

Several projects are either in the pipeline or currently being implemented, including:

- **Automatic Backup to the Cloud**: Ensuring that all data is securely backed up in the cloud.
- **Better Secrets Management**: Improving the security and accessibility of sensitive information.
- **Automatic Deployment of New VM/Hardware**: Streamlining the process of adding new resources to the lab.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment for efficient management.
- **LDAP Server**: Centralizing authentication and authorization for various services.
- **Prometheus Speed Test Script**: Transitioning the speed test tracker to a script that leverages Prometheus for monitoring.
- *...and more.*

## Current Implementation

The homelab is presently operational with the following configurations:

- **Caddy**: Used as a reverse proxy to manage and secure internal and external access to services.
- **Authelia**: Employed for robust authentication and authorization controls.
- **Docker Compose**: Most services are orchestrated using Docker Compose.
